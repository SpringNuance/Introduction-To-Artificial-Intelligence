    "## Text generation with OpenAI's GPT-2 model\n",
    "\n",
    "This week you explore the language model that you read about in the first exercise on this course [1]. GPT-2 is a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization—all without task-specific training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if other models have been published after GPT-2, this model demonstrates the capabilities of a large transformer-based language model and shows off some interesting, fun, and even scary use-cases of the model. The model has 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages, and it has been trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We try to explore a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic text samples, where we prime the model with an input (i.e., how the text should start) and have it generate a lengthy continuation. The model adapts to the style and content of the conditioning text. This allows the user to generate (more or less) coherent continuations about a topic of their choosing. This implementation is based on [3] with slight modifications for educational purposes. It also goes without saying, we don't take any responsibilty of the content that the AI generates—don't be offended :) Also note that we use the smaller ~500 Mb trained model here for convenience.\n",
